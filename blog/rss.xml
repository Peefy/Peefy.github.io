            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This blog is a review of the content of the KCL speech at the 2023 CNCF KCD Hangzhou Conference. Activity link: <a href="https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-hangzhou-presents-kcd-hangzhou-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-hangzhou-presents-kcd-hangzhou-2023/</a></p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>With the development of cloud-native technology, we are increasingly shifting towards cloud infrastructure. Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Kubernetes and Terraform have become increasingly popular for managing and deploying cloud API-based applications. However, this popularity has also brought about complexity and cognitive burden issues that have reached their peak in recent years.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="cognitive-loading" src="/assets/images/cognitive-loading-en-f1a2311975793d4cc1caecb4f1126877.jpg" width="2076" height="1248" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For Kubernetes, as the most widely used container orchestration system, Gartner predicts that by 2022, over 75% of organizations globally will be running containerized applications in production. The container management market is estimated to be around 300 million dollars, projected to surpass 1 billion dollars by 2025. Additionally, Kubernetes is steadily moving out of its troubled phase towards maturity and wider adoption<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p>For Terraform, as the most widely used IaC tool, as of the time of writing this article, the Terraform VS Code plugin has an installation count of around 3.2 million, roughly one-third of the installation count of the Go VS Code plugin (around 10 million), and even surpasses the installation count of many general-purpose programming languages. For example, the Rust VS Code plugin has an installation count of around 2.3 million. Furthermore, HCL is the fastest-growing programming language on GitHub in 2022, surpassing all other general-purpose and domain-specific programming languages, forming a wide developer ecosystem<sup>[2]</sup>.</p><p>From this, it can be seen that Kubernetes and Terraform are becoming indispensable infrastructure projects in the cloud-native field and will continue to grow in the coming years. Although the nature of these two projects is not entirely the same, they are converging and becoming increasingly complex.</p><p>The increasing complexity of the cloud API represented by Kubernetes and Terraform can be attributed to several factors<sup>[3]</sup><sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup>:</p><ul><li><strong>Increasing capabilities</strong>: Kubernetes and cloud APIs are constantly evolving to meet the growing demands of applications and cloud computing. To meet user demands, they continuously introduce new features and capabilities such as auto-scaling, service discovery, load balancing, and permission management. The introduction of these new features increases the complexity of the system. Although we already have various automation methods, over time, the number of different resource types, potential settings for these resource types, and the complexity of relationships between these resource types grow exponentially.</li><li><strong>Complex configuration management requirements</strong>: As the scale of applications grows, configuring and managing Kubernetes and cloud APIs becomes increasingly complex. For example, managing a large number of container instances and resources, configuring complex networking and storage, implementing high availability and load balancing, and repeatedly performing configurations for different environments and topologies. These complex configuration and management requirements increase the complexity of Kubernetes and cloud APIs, often resulting in the emergence of "YAML engineers" or "markup language human-editing engineers" in the Kubernetes field.</li></ul><p>For cloud APIs, we can leverage IaC tools like Terraform to obtain a large number of pre-written module configurations and providers. However, for Kubernetes, there is still a lack of lightweight client-side configuration composition and abstraction solutions. Existing solutions or specifications struggle to strike a balance between abstraction capabilities and scalability. In extreme scenarios, developers often write a lot of glue code and scripts to handle configurations, which restricts stability and efficiency.</p><p>Therefore, we propose the KCL project and the KRM KCL specification, hoping to fill the gap in configuration languages and tools in the lightweight client-side cloud-native dynamic configuration field with more modern declarative configuration languages and tools. We aim to address the following issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Dimension explosion</strong>: Most static configurations, such as Kubernetes YAML configurations in the cloud-native field, need to be configured separately for each environment. In the worst case, it may introduce difficult-to-debug errors involving cross-environment dependencies, leading to poor stability and scalability.</li><li><strong>Configuration drift</strong>: There is often no standardized way to manage the dynamic configurations of applications and infrastructure for different environments. Adopting non-standard methods such as scripting and piecing together glue code can result in exponential complexity and configuration drift.</li><li><strong>Cognitive burden</strong>: Kubernetes and other platform technologies that serve as building platforms excel in unifying infrastructure details at the underlying level. However, they lack higher-level software delivery abstractions, which result in a higher cognitive burden for ordinary developers and affect the software delivery experience of higher-level application developers.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="concepts">Concepts<a href="#concepts" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kcl">KCL<a href="#kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="kcl-intro" src="/assets/images/kcl-intro-en-425b3d2b1e4f95ea0b76f231b72dbcad.jpg" width="864" height="988" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>KCL is a specialized configuration policy language for the cloud-native domain. It was open-sourced in June 2022 and became a CNCF Sandbox project hosted by the CNCF foundation in September 2023. KCL aims to improve the user experience of writing cloud-native configuration policies and programmability at the Kubernetes API layer. The KCL project is currently included in the CNCF foundation's Automation &amp; Configuration Landscape. The "C" in KCL stands for Configuration, the "L" stands for Language, and the "K" is derived from the first letter of Kubernetes<sup>[6]</sup>.</p><p>Unlike general-purpose programming languages, KCL is a domain-specific programming language that solves nearly infinite variations of business scenarios and complexities with a convergent set of syntax and semantics. For example, within the Kubernetes domain alone, there are thousands of resources and a fragmented Operator ecosystem in the community. KCL encapsulates the thought process and approach of writing complex configurations and policies into its language features, avoiding the security risks and side effects associated with using general-purpose languages for configuration.</p><p>As a configuration language, KCL provides the most important functionality for application and platform developers/SREs, which is <strong>dynamic configuration management</strong>. Through code abstraction, we can build an application-centric model that shields developers from the complexities of infrastructure and platform concepts and provides them with an interface that is centered around the application and easy to understand. Additionally, KCL allows platform engineers to quickly extend and define their own models, and it provides rich manageability capabilities, including out-of-the-box KCL code libraries, semantic versioning, OCI Registry, language toolchains, and automation support.</p><p>Furthermore, KCL operates within a completely open cloud-native ecosystem and is not tightly coupled to any orchestration/engineering tools or Kubernetes controllers. In cloud-native supply chain scenarios and large-scale operational scenarios, KCL can provide API abstraction, composition, and validation capabilities for both the client and runtime. Users can choose suitable engines such as Kubectl<sup>[7]</sup>, KusionStack<sup>[8]</sup>, KubeVela<sup>[9]</sup>, or Helmfile<sup>[10]</sup> to combine with KCL and apply configurations to the cluster.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="kcl-concept" src="/assets/images/kcl-concept-en-4b4f5df329657fe3ba882662a3ec487a.jpg" width="2342" height="1088" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition, KCL itself is a modern, high-level domain-specific programming language, which is a compiled static and strongly-typed language. KCL provides developers with the core capabilities of <strong>configuration (config)</strong>, <strong>model abstraction (schema)</strong>, <strong>logic (lambda)</strong>, and <strong>policies (rules)</strong> through a record and function-oriented language design.</p><p>KCL aims to provide programmability independent of the runtime, without providing system functionalities such as threads and IO locally. It strives to offer programming support that is stable, secure, low-noise, low side-effect, high-performance, easy to automate, and easy to manage in order to solve domain-specific problems.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krm-kcl-specification">KRM KCL Specification<a href="#krm-kcl-specification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="krm-kcl" src="/assets/images/krm-kcl-en-cd9bf73c68f0d110d59e6b2ffe5e5ca7.jpg" width="2346" height="1134" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The KRM KCL specification is a configuration specification based on the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM). KRM is a generic configuration model used to describe and manage various cloud-native resources such as containers, pods, and services. KRM provides a unified way to define and manage these resources, enabling them to be portable and reusable across different environments<sup>[11]</sup>.</p><p>As one of the official Kubernetes specifications, the core concept of KRM is KRM functions. The input of KRM functions is a set of Kubernetes resources and the configuration of the KRM function, and the output is a set of Kubernetes resources along with the results of the function execution, such as error messages and debug information. KRM KCL is the implementation of KRM functions using KCL code and extends it with support for various code sources such as OCI Registry, Git, and HTTPS.</p><p>In the KRM KCL specification, the behaviors of the KCL configuration model are mainly divided into three categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Mutation</strong>: Takes input KCL parameters <code>params</code> and a list of KRM resources and outputs a modified list of KRM resources.</li><li><strong>Validation</strong>: Takes input KCL parameters <code>params</code> and a list of KRM resources and outputs the list of KRM resources and resource validation results.</li><li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Takes input KCL parameters <code>params</code> and outputs a list of KRM resources.</li></ul><p>Using KCL, we can achieve the following capabilities programmatically:</p><ul><li>Modify resources using KCL, such as adding/modifying label tags or annotation comments based on certain conditions or injecting Sidecar container configurations in all Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) resources containing PodTemplate.</li><li>Validate all KRM resources using KCL schema, such as constraining containers to only be launched in a root manner.</li><li>Generate KRM resources or abstract/combine different Kubernetes APIs using the abstraction model, for example, instantiating a web application configuration using the "web-service" model.</li></ul><p>With the help of KCL IDE and KCL package management tools, we can write models and upload them to the OCI Registry for model reuse. We can programmatically extend the support for the KRM KCL specification, and these models can be used separately in the client or runtime based on specific scenario requirements.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="developer-experience">Developer Experience<a href="#developer-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Regarding the mentioned domain-specific problems and the related concepts of KCL, we primarily provide three aspects of support to users: language, toolchain, and cloud-native integrations.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="workspace" src="/assets/images/workspace-f5bf20ccd0e89ed8cc99d85a900b376e.png" width="1974" height="1164" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Although KCL is a domain-specific language, it is comprehensive in its capabilities. KCL provides toolchain functionalities that are equivalent to general-purpose languages, such as formatting, testing, documentation, package management, etc., to assist in writing, understanding, and validating configurations or policies. IDE plugins like VS Code and Playground reduce the cost of configuration writing and sharing. Automation of configuration management and execution is achieved through multilingual SDKs in Rust, Go, and Python.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ide" src="/assets/images/ide-a6076d6022bf21ae4a2b380c2307fd01.png" width="2432" height="1190" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For IDE plugins, KCL currently mainly supports VS Code, IntelliJ, and NeoVim. These plugins, based on the same KCL Language Server, offer features like autocompletion, navigation, hover, code refactoring, and formatting<sup>[12]</sup>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="integration" src="/assets/images/integration-en-ec1c9b89d0e409a07b09adaafbf3ca7d.jpg" width="1130" height="1032" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As a CNCF project, KCL is integrated with many other CNCF ecosystem projects. For example, KCL provides plugins for existing CNCF ecosystem configuration management tools like Kubectl, Helm, Kustomize, kpt, helmfile, etc. At runtime, KCL offers the KCL Kubernetes Operator to meet various configuration management needs. Additionally, we provide the following integration support:</p><ul><li><strong>Multilingual Support</strong>: We offer multilingual SDKs to help users work with KCL in different programming languages and integrate it into their own applications.</li><li><strong>Package Management Support</strong>: We provide KCL package management tools that allow distribution and reuse of configurations and policy code through standard OCI supply chain methods like Harbor, Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, etc.</li><li><strong>Schema and Data Migration Support</strong>: We support one-click migration of schema and data from other ecosystems to KCL Schema, including Go/Rust struct definitions, JsonSchema, Protobuf, OpenAPI, Terraform Provider Schema, JSON, YAML, and more.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="artifact-hub" src="/assets/images/artifact-hub-508b49dd9554d933cccba9661d6ba98b.png" width="1806" height="1250" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="artifact-hub-k8s" src="/assets/images/artifact-hub-k8s-c0f1ceb26e3bcb4a6f76085468321598.png" width="1080" height="753" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Furthermore, KCL supports integration with ArtifactHub. You can publish your KCL package to ArtifactHub by submitting a PR to the <code>kcl-lang/artifacthub</code> repository. This allows you to see the effects of the uploaded KCL package on the ArtifactHub page, such as the k8s package<sup>[13]</sup>.</p><p>In addition to that, KCL provides many out-of-the-box cloud-native models, primarily covering <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and <strong>Terraform</strong> models. Developers can easily add corresponding configuration model dependencies or view the KCL source code with just one line of KCL command.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="performance" src="/assets/images/performance-2358c8f2881d48f85b8365082cb5f2cd.png" width="1992" height="1070" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to the external work related to language, toolchain, and cloud-native integration, we have also made significant efforts to ensure stability and performance within KCL. In scenarios with large code bases or high computational requirements, KCL outperforms languages like CUE, Jsonnet, HCL, etc. Furthermore, KCL's progressive static typing system, immutability, schema, and validation rules ensure further stability of configurations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="case-studies">Case Studies<a href="#case-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kubernetes">Kubernetes<a href="#kubernetes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>KCL currently focuses on the cloud-native domain, particularly in Kubernetes scenarios.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="k8s-mutation" src="/assets/images/k8s-mutation-en-b5175adde14cea6c53786ea0ea9bcd28.jpg" width="2168" height="898" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As a small programming language within the cloud-native domain, KCL can be directly used to address simple tasks in the environment. For example, the <code>append-env</code> model can be used to inject environment variables into Kubernetes resources without the need for scripting. These models are shareable, reusable, and have been tested for code reliability, stability, and scalability.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="k8s-validation" src="/assets/images/k8s-validation-en-34d59d4ef44abd1d2e078380743149f4.jpg" width="2044" height="1048" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to in-place editing of Kubernetes configurations, KCL offers a variety of out-of-the-box models for Kubernetes configuration validation. These models address security and compliance issues in the cloud-native supply chain. For example, the <code>disallow-svc-lb</code> model can be used to validate whether the <code>Service</code> resource incorrectly sets the <code>LoadBalancer</code> type, and the <code>https-only</code> model can verify if the <code>Ingress</code> resource contains explicit annotations set to use https.</p><p>Compared to other policy tools or engines, the advantage of using KCL is that a validation model can be used both on the client side and at runtime. Schema and constraint conditions can be defined simultaneously in the programming language interface, without the need for additional OpenAPI Schema or JSON Schema integration.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="kcl-operator" src="/assets/images/kcl-operator-en-3514180a1b5d0ee53bf0264078e83781.jpg" width="2146" height="1190" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to abstracting, editing, and verifying configurations on the client side, KCL also provides runtime support. KCL Operator provides Kubernetes cluster integration, allowing Access Webhook to generate, mutate, or validate resources based on KCL configuration when applying Kubernetes resources to the cluster. Webhook will capture creation, application, and editing operations, and <code>KCLRun</code> will execute resources on the configuration associated with each operation<sup>[14]</sup>.</p><p>Using the KCL Operator, resource configuration management and security verification can be automated in a lightweight manner within the Kubernetes cluster through KCL code in a few steps, without the need to repeatedly develop Webhook Server to dynamically modify and verify configurations at runtime.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="terraform">Terraform<a href="#terraform" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Another scenario that KCL focuses on is the ecosystem model of Terraform.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="tf-validation" src="/assets/images/tf-validation-en-4ae35f870e761b09df6ddf9b6978b605.jpg" width="1118" height="1122" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the cloud-native supply chain scenario, apart from the user's business code, it is often necessary to verify the security of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) code. Therefore, KCL also provides validation models related to Terraform. For example, the example shown in the image only requires a few lines of KCL code to enforce the requirement of not deleting resources during automatic scaling operations in an AWS resource group<sup>[15]</sup>.</p><p>Compared to other policy engines or tools, KCL supports easy conversion from Terraform Provider Schema to KCL Schema, making policy writing more accessible.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="iac--gitops">IaC &amp; GitOps<a href="#iac--gitops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="gitops" src="/assets/images/gitops-en-248e330733a07c2ff97683ac3149f360.jpg" width="2410" height="790" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Whether it is the Kubernetes model or the Terraform model, and whether it is using the standalone KCL or KRM KCL configuration format, KCL supports integration with various CI/CD and GitOps tools. KCL allows developers to define the resources required for an application in a declarative manner. By combining KCL with GitOps tools, we can achieve better Infrastructure as Code (IaC) implementation, improve deployment efficiency, and simplify application configuration management<sup>[16]</sup>.</p><p>With GitOps, developers and operations teams can manage the deployment of applications by separately modifying application and configuration code. The GitOps toolchain can automatically change configurations based on the automation capabilities of KCL, enabling continuous deployment and ensuring consistency. If any issues arise, the GitOps toolchain allows for quick rollbacks.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="app-delivery" src="/assets/images/app-delivery-en-98ebef687c17b62ace75fcbf6a46baf9.jpg" width="2114" height="968" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>KCL can also be used in conjunction with various CI/CD and application configuration delivery engines within an enterprise, such as KusionStack, to achieve separation of concerns, application-centric programmable model interfaces, and GitOps workflows. This simplifies the deployment and operations of scalable applications in today's hybrid and multi-cloud environments, enhancing release and operations efficiency as well as developer experience.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="k8s-abstraction" src="/assets/images/k8s-abstraction-en-d8d40f06811fa835b6891e1f0f2c2782.jpg" width="2230" height="1042" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Furthermore, with the Schema structure and automation API of KCL, we can integrate KCL into external systems and use CLI/API/UI forms to automate the addition, deletion, modification, and retrieval of KCL configurations. This not only enables GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) but also provides a user-friendly configuration management interface for developers. It supports changes to KCL code in the form of UI forms, improving the efficiency of configuration management and application delivery while avoiding configuration drift and other issues.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This article mainly reviews the content of the KCL presentation at the CNCF KCD community conference. It discusses the challenges encountered in the cloud-native domain, especially in the Kubernetes and Terraform ecosystems, as well as the concepts, user experiences, and practices of the KRM KCL specification.</p><p>Of course, the problems that KCL can solve and the scenarios it can be applied to are much broader than what is covered in this article. Due to the limitations of the article length, we will continue to share the best practices of adopters in the community.

It is a significant step towards dynamic configuration management and automation capabilities for cloud native application delivery.</p><ul><li><em>Project Link: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl</a></em></li><li><em>Project Website: <a href="https://kcl-lang.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://kcl-lang.io</a></em></li></ul><p>By joining CNCF as a sandbox project, the KCL community aims to attract more developers and users to contribute and further promote the mature application of the project in cloud native scenarios. In addition, joining CNCF provides KCL with an enhanced platform for collaboration and innovation. It offers an opportunity to engage with a diverse community of developers, organizations, and industry experts at the forefront of cloud native technology. We look forward to collaborating with other CNCF projects, contributing our technical expertise, and exploring the possibilities of integrating with more CNCF projects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-cncf">What is CNCF?<a href="#what-is-cncf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>CNCF, short for Cloud Native Computing Foundation, is a sub-foundation under the Linux Foundation. CNCF is dedicated to building a sustainable ecosystem for cloud native software, covering areas such as storage, computing, orchestration, scheduling, CI/CD, DevOps, service governance, and service gateways.</p><p><em>Kubernetes is one of the most representative projects of CNCF</em>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-cncf-sandbox-project">What is CNCF Sandbox Project?<a href="#what-is-cncf-sandbox-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="cncf-sandbox-logo" src="/assets/images/cncf-sandbox-logo-b53944d3e90e9c2789be2eebcbd36e82.png" width="1080" height="243" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The CNCF community classifies projects into Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated. Well-known graduated projects include Kubernetes, Prometheus, Istio, ETCD, Containerd, ArgoCD, and Helm. For a complete list of graduated and incubating projects, you can visit <a href="https://www.cncf.io/projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cncf.io/projects/</a>.</p><p>Sandbox is a category created by CNCF to provide a beneficial and neutral home for open source projects to promote collaboration and development. Projects selected for the Sandbox are recognized by the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) and have the potential for experimentation and development. You can find the list of Sandbox projects at <a href="https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/</a>. To enter the Sandbox, at least 66% of the TOC members (all 11 people listed at <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc#members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cncf/toc#members</a>) need to vote in favor, which means at least 8 people.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-kcl">What is KCL?<a href="#what-is-kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>KCL is an open-source, constraint-based record and function language. It aims to improve the writing of complex configurations, such as cloud-native Kubernetes configurations, using mature programming language techniques and practices. KCL focuses on modularity, extensibility, and stability around configuration, aiming to create a simpler logic writing experience and build a simpler path for automation and ecosystem integration.</p><p>Key milestones of the project include:</p><ul><li>May 2022: KCL was initiated and officially open-sourced by Ant Group.</li><li>June 2023: KCL became an official CNCF Landscape project.</li><li>September 2023: KCL was reviewed by the CNCF Application Delivery TAG and approved through TOC voting, officially becoming a CNCF Sandbox project (<a href="https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/48" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/48</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-we-need-kcl">Why do we need KCL?<a href="#why-do-we-need-kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Just like recording music with a staff and storing time series data in a sequential database, we use specialized configuration and policy languages to write and manage large-scale complex configurations and policies within specific problem domains of cloud native configuration and automation. Unlike high-level general-purpose languages with hybrid writing paradigms and hybrid engineering capabilities, the core logic of specialized languages is to solve domain problems with almost infinite changes and complexity through a converged finite set of syntax and semantics, and to deposit complex configuration and strategy writing ideas and methods into language characteristics.</p><p>In addition, KCL hopes to fill the gap in configuration languages and tools in the field of lightweight client cloud native dynamic configuration through more modern declarative configuration languages and tools, and address the following issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Configuration Bloat</strong>: Most static configurations such as Kubernetes YAML in the cloud native domain need to be configured separately for each environment; In the worst-case scenario, it may introduce difficult to debug errors involving environmental cross linking, with poor stability and scalability.</li><li><strong>Configuration Drift</strong>: There is often no standard way to manage the static configuration of applications and infrastructure in different environments. Using non-standard methods such as combining scripts and glue code can lead to exponential complexity growth and configuration drift.</li><li><strong>Cognitive loading</strong>: Kubernetes and others, as platform technology tools for building platforms, excel in the details of the underlying unified infrastructure, but lack higher-level abstraction for application software delivery, which has a high cognitive loading on ordinary developers and affects the software delivery experience of higher-level application developers.</li></ul><p>In response to the above issues, KCL expects to provide the following capabilities:</p><ul><li>Shielding the details and complexity of infrastructure and platforms through methods such as code <strong>abstraction</strong>, reducing the cognitive loading on developers.</li><li><strong>Mutate</strong> and <strong>Validate</strong> existing inventory configurations or templates to directly solve cloud generated small configuration scenarios such as Helm Chart configuration hard coding issues, but it goes far beyond that.</li><li>Improve team collaboration efficiency by <strong>managing large-scale configuration</strong> data across teams without side effects through language configuration.</li></ul><p>Specifically, KCL can</p><ul><li>Improve the ability of <strong>configuration semantic verification</strong> at the code level, such as schema definition, field optional/mandatory, type, range, and other configuration check and verification capabilities.</li><li>Provide the ability to write, combine, and abstract **configuration blocks, such as structural definition, structural inheritance, constraint definition, and configuration policy merging.</li><li>Improve configuration flexibility through <strong>modern programming languages</strong> and <strong>writing code</strong>, such as conditional statements, loops, functions, package management, and other features to enhance configuration reuse capabilities.</li><li>Provide <strong>comprehensive tool chain support</strong>, rich IDE plugins, languages, and ecological tool chain support to reduce the threshold of getting started and improve the user experience.</li><li>By using <strong>package management tools</strong> and <strong>OCI registry</strong>, configurations can be shared, propagated, and delivered in a simpler way among different teams/roles.</li><li>Provide <strong>high-performance</strong> compilers to meet the requirements of large-scale configuration scenarios, such as meeting the rendering performance requirements of generating configurations of different environments and topologies based on deployment context from a baseline configuration, as well as the performance requirements of automatic configuration modification.</li><li>By enhancing its automation and integration capabilities through means such as <strong>multilingual SDK and KCL language plugin</strong>, it can significantly reduce the learning cost of KCL while leveraging the value of configuration and policy writing.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/kcl-overview-315e5b285928477465eb35cd948465b8.png" width="702" height="419" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to the language itself, KCL also provides many additional tools such as formatting, testing, documentation, etc. to help you use, understand, and check the written configuration or strategy; Reduce the cost of configuration writing and sharing through IDE plugins such as VS Code, package management tools, and Playground; Automatically manage and execute configurations through Rust, Go, and Python multilingual SDKs.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-can-kcl-do">What can KCL do?<a href="#what-can-kcl-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dynamic-configuration-management">Dynamic Configuration Management<a href="#dynamic-configuration-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="standalone-kcl-form" src="/assets/images/standalone-kcl-form-499fd62a1d02c6c23b7ed8d4914c455b.png" width="2252" height="1194" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As a configuration language, the most important feature that KCL provides to application and platform developers/SREs is dynamic configuration management. Through code abstraction, we can build an application-centric model that shields complex infrastructure and platform concepts, providing developers with a centralized and easy-to-understand interface. Additionally, KCL allows platform personnel to quickly extend and define their own models, which can be shared and reused through the OCI registry.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="krm-kcl-form" src="/assets/images/krm-kcl-form-3e0ac516e88e65ac80c211f625bc1f34.png" width="2166" height="1076" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Furthermore, KCL also supports direct integration with the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) specification. KRM KCL is a generic configuration model specification used to describe and manage various cloud native resources, such as container, pod, and service configurations and abstractions. The KRM KCL specification provides a unified way to define and manage these resources, enabling them to be portable and reusable across different environments. It operates in a fully open Kubernetes world, with minimal binding to any orchestration/engine tools or Kubernetes controllers. It allows platform personnel to extend their abstractions, configuration editing and validation logic, while providing a developer-friendly configuration management interface based on the separation of concerns.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gitops">GitOps<a href="#gitops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" alt="gitops" src="/assets/images/gitops-bbba7c639b8c999d6cbc87d8f1c2cc15.png" width="2182" height="1018" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Whether using standalone KCL or KRM KCL configuration forms, we support integration between KCL and various CI/CD and GitOps tools. KCL allows developers to define the resources required by applications in a declarative manner. By combining KCL with GitOps tools, we can better achieve Infrastructure as Code (IaC), improve deployment efficiency, and simplify application configuration management.</p><p>With GitOps, developers and operations teams can manage application deployments by separately modifying application and configuration code. The GitOps toolchain can automatically make changes to the configuration based on the automation capabilities of KCL, enabling continuous deployment and ensuring consistency. If any issues arise, the GitOps toolchain can quickly roll back the changes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="integrations">Integrations<a href="#integrations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="integration" src="/assets/images/integration-e4e36aeb48fcc6de8aae0c00e5070723.png" width="2192" height="1048" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In addition to integrating with GitOps automation tools like ArgoCD, as a CNCF project, KCL has also integrated with many other CNCF ecosystem projects. For example, it provides KCL plugins for existing CNCF ecosystem configuration management tools such as Helm, Kustomize, and kpt. It also provides a KCL Kubernetes Operator at runtime to meet different configuration management needs. Furthermore, we offer the following integration support:</p><ul><li><strong>Multi-language support</strong>: We provide multi-language SDKs to help users operate KCL in different languages and integrate it into their own applications.</li><li><strong>Package management support</strong>: We provide the KPM package management tool to distribute and reuse KCL configurations through Docker Hub, GitHub container registry, etc.</li><li><strong>Schema migration support</strong>: We support one-click migration of schemas from other ecosystems to KCL schemas, such as Go/Rust struct definitions, JsonSchema, Protobuf, OpenAPI, Terraform Provider Schema, etc.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="practices">Practices<a href="#practices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="practice-krm-kcl" src="/assets/images/practice-krm-kcl-1ee09831b8dc50884175002184e44063.png" width="3538" height="1040" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Firstly, as a small language in the cloud-native field, KCL can be directly used to solve simple problems in scenarios. For example, using the KCL model to directly inject environment variables for Kubernetes resources, and using the KCL model and Helm KCL plugins to non-invasively handle the hard-coded configuration of Helm Charts instead of directly modifying the Helm Chart by forking it.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="practice-konfig-gitops" src="/assets/images/practice-konfig-gitops-32092b98b555d3597ce893c7a74eca5b.png" width="1812" height="892" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Secondly, KCL can also be used in conjunction with various CI/CD and application configuration delivery engines such as <a href="https://kusionstack.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KusionStack</a> within enterprises to achieve separation of concerns, application-centric programmable model interfaces, and GitOps processes. This simplifies the deployment and operation of scaled applications in today's hybrid multi-cloud environments, improving release and operation efficiency and developer experience.</p><p>Of course, KCL can solve more problems and scenarios than mentioned above. We will continue to share best practices from adopters in the community, and we welcome everyone to join our community for further discussions and exchanges ❤️. <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/community</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community">Community<a href="#community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="community" src="/assets/images/community-07fc26fccb17f189e8cbf91ef011486a.png" width="2166" height="1092" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In just one year of KCL being open source, we have released many versions and built the KCL community in collaboration with contributors and maintainers from all over the world. We have also gained recognition from some adopters, such as Youzan and Huawei. By joining CNCF, our goal is to increase project visibility and drive community adoption and participation, as strong and well-known foundation organizations are crucial for advancing the development of language ecosystems.</p><p>Additionally, we have received recognition from companions in the open-source community from all over the world, including China, North America, Europe, and Australia. We thank all the users and community developers who have accompanied KCL on this journey, and we welcome more companions to join our community and build together ❤️.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For KCL, joining CNCF does not mean the end, but a new beginning. We will work together with our community companions to build a better KCL language, toolchain, and IDE experience!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The KCL team is pleased to announce that KCL v0.6.0 is now available! This release has brought three key updates to everyone: <strong>Language</strong>, <strong>Tools</strong>, and <strong>Integrations</strong>.</p><ul><li><em>Use KCL language, tools and IDE extensions with more complete features and fewer errors to improve code writing experience and efficiency.</em></li><li><em>Use KPM, OCI Registry and other tools to directly use and share your cloud native domain models, reducing learning and hands-on costs.</em></li><li><em>Use cloud-native integration extensions such as Helmfile KCL plugin and KCL Operator to simultaneously support in-place mutation and validation of Kubernetes resources on both the client and runtime, avoiding hardcoded configurations.</em></li></ul><p>You can visit the <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/releases/tag/v0.6.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL release page</a> or the <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL website</a> to get KCL binary download link and more detailed release information.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL</a> is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language. KCL improves the writing of numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology and practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, and stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, and great built-in or API-driven integrations.</p><p>This blog will introduce the content of KCL v0.6.0 and recent developments in the KCL community to readers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="language">Language<a href="#language" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-type-system-enhancement">🔧 Type system enhancement<a href="#-type-system-enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Support automatic type inference for KCL configuration block attributes. Prior to version 0.6.0 of KCL, the key1 and key2 attributes in the code snippet below would be inferred as type str | int. With the updated version, we have further improved the precision of type inference for configuration attributes, so key1 and key2 will have more specific and precise corresponding types.</p><div class="language-python codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-python codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">config </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    key1 </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"value1"</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    key2 </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:#36acaa">2</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">key1 </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> config</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">key1  </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># The type of key1 is str</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">key2 </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> config</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">key2  </span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># The type of key2 is int</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>In addition, we have optimized error messages for schema semantic checking, union type checking, and type checking errors in system library functions.</p><p>For more information, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/pull/678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-api-update">🏄 API Update<a href="#-api-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>KCL Schema model parsing: The GetSchemaType API is used to retrieve KCL package-related information and default values for schema attributes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-bug-fixes">🐞 Bug Fixes<a href="#-bug-fixes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fix-schema-requiredoptional-attribute-check-in-kcl">Fix schema required/optional attribute check in KCL<a href="#fix-schema-requiredoptional-attribute-check-in-kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In previous versions of KCL, the required/optional attribute check for KCL would miss nested schema attribute checks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><blockquote><p>With the development of cloud-native technologies, we are increasingly shifting towards cloud infrastructure. Tools such as Kubernetes and Terraform have become increasingly popular for managing and deploying applications based on cloud APIs. However, along with this popularity, the complexity and cognitive burden associated with these tools have reached a peak in recent years.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="cognitive-loading" src="/assets/images/cognitive-loading-111a520883f2ce7c45b730c3f84543e6.png" width="1492" height="742" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The increasing complexity of Kubernetes and cloud APIs can be attributed to several factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Growing functionality and capabilities</strong>: Kubernetes and cloud APIs continuously evolve to meet the growing demands of applications and the development of cloud computing. To fulfill user requirements, new functionalities and capabilities such as auto-scaling, service discovery, load balancing, and permission management are constantly introduced. The introduction of these new features adds to the complexity of the system. Despite the availability of various automation methods, over time, the exponential growth in the number of different resource types, potential settings for these resource types, and the complex relationships between them pose challenges.</li><li><strong>Complex configuration and management requirements</strong>: As applications scale, configuring and managing Kubernetes and cloud APIs becomes increasingly complex. This includes managing a large number of container instances and resources, configuring intricate networking and storage setups, ensuring high availability and load balancing, and repetitive configurations for different environments and topologies. These complex configuration and management requirements contribute to the overall complexity of Kubernetes and cloud APIs, sometimes leading to the emergence of "YAML engineers" as a joking reference.</li></ul><p>Despite the increasing complexity of Kubernetes and cloud APIs, they provide powerful functionalities and flexibility to help organizations effectively manage and scale their applications. By utilizing appropriate tools, engineering practices, and methods, this complexity can be alleviated, enabling efficient utilization of these technologies to meet business needs. Dynamic configuration management techniques are one of the approaches that can help address the complexity of Kubernetes and cloud APIs to a certain extent.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-dynamic-configuration-management">What is Dynamic Configuration Management<a href="#what-is-dynamic-configuration-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We follow the <a href="https://humanitec.com/blog/what-is-dynamic-configuration-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original definition of Dynamic Configuration Management (DCM)</a> by its creator Chris Stephenson and extend it to a certain extent.</p><blockquote><p>Dynamic Configuration Management (DCM) is an approach to constructing the configuration of computational workloads. Developers create workload specifications that describe everything necessary for the workload to run successfully. These specifications are used to dynamically generate configurations for deploying the workload in specific environments. With DCM, developers do not need to define or maintain environment-specific configurations for their workloads.</p></blockquote><p>Dynamic Configuration Management means that developers describe the relationship between their workloads and resources in an <strong>abstract</strong> and <strong>environment-agnostic</strong> manner. They describe this relationship in a format called a workload specification or application-centric specification. The specification is generic and works across environments, which means it doesn't provide enough information to configure the workloads and resources themselves. To obtain executable configurations, we need to apply the specification to configuration baselines (for application and infrastructure configurations) and generate them based on the deployment context. For developers, Dynamic Configuration Management requires providing an application-centric configuration interface that they can understand. For platform engineers, Dynamic Configuration Management can help define how to handle configuration resources and workload specifications, leading to improved consistency and compliance within the organization. It also makes it easier to provide a self-service Internal Developer Platform (IDP).</p><p>In contrast to dynamic configuration management, static configuration management brings about a series of issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Configuration Bloat</strong>: Most static configurations require separate configurations for each environment, and in the worst case, it can introduce difficult-to-debug errors involving cross-linking between environments, leading to poor stability and scalability.</li><li><strong>Configuration Drift</strong>: Managing application and infrastructure configurations for different environments with static management approaches often lacks standardized methods for handling dynamic variations in configurations across environments. Employing non-standardized approaches can result in exponential complexity and lead to configuration drift.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-do-we-need-a-new-paradigm">Why Do We Need a New Paradigm<a href="#why-do-we-need-a-new-paradigm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Just as music is recorded on musical sheets and time-series data is stored in time-series databases, a set of configuration and policy languages is used for writing and managing scalable and complex configurations and policies in the specific problem domain of platform engineering. Unlike high-level general-purpose languages with mixed paradigms and mixed engineering capabilities, these domain-specific languages are built upon a converged, finite syntax and semantic set to tackle the near-infinite variations and complexities of the domain's problems, consolidating the mindset and approach to writing complex configurations and policies into the language's features.</p><p>For cloud APIs, we can leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform to obtain a vast library of pre-written module configurations. However, when it comes to Kubernetes, there is still a lack of lightweight client-side configuration composition and abstraction solutions. Existing solutions or specifications struggle to strike a balance between abstraction capabilities and scalability. In extreme scenarios, developers often resort to writing glue code and scripts to handle configuration processing logic, which hinders stability and efficiency. For instance, although tools like Helm Chart provide template programming, the programming experience and efficiency are subpar. Additionally, when users need to dynamically adjust dependencies on <code>values.yaml</code> parameters in Helm Charts or encounter upstream Helm Charts that don't support the required parameter settings, they often resort to forking and maintaining the upstream Helm Charts in an intrusive manner or supplementing with tools like Kustomize, incurring additional maintenance costs and complexities.</p><p>Therefore, we contemplate the need for a unified specification that can simultaneously support configuration language capabilities and, with minimal side effects, fulfill the requirements of stability, scalability, and efficiency in the context of scalable configuration scenarios. This specification should also address the problems inherent in static configuration management.</p><ul><li><strong>Abstraction and Composition Capabilities</strong>: By providing a programmable schema, the platform personnel can shield the underlying infrastructure details and platform, while offering developers a better and more stable API abstraction.</li><li><strong>Stability</strong>: By providing stable features out-of-the-box, such as rule writing and static typing, the specification enables risk mitigation and early error detection in version control systems (VCS), allowing for auditing, traceability, and rollback, and facilitating automation.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Similar to the application software supply chain, infrastructure configuration should be treated as part of the software supply chain. Users can distribute and reuse configurations in a standardized manner, easily accessing commonly used configurations in the open-source world. For internal platforms, we can easily write and extend configuration code.</li><li><strong>High performance</strong>: Since dynamic configuration management advocates generating configurations for different environments and topologies based on a baseline configuration and deployment context, there is a high demand for the rendering performance of the configuration code itself. Developers typically do not want to spend several minutes waiting for the actual configuration output, as it would hinder software iteration and upgrade efficiency.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="krm-kcl-specification">KRM KCL Specification<a href="#krm-kcl-specification" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/krm-kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KRM KCL specification</a> is a configuration specification based on the Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM). KRM is a universal configuration model used to describe and manage various cloud-native resources such as containers, pods, and services. It provides a unified way to define and manage these resources, enabling portability and reuse across different environments. It exists within the open Kubernetes ecosystem, decoupled from any specific orchestration/engine tools or Kubernetes controllers. It allows platform personnel to extend their abstractions, configuration editing, and validation logic, while also enabling direct reuse of existing model abstractions from the community, such as the Open Application Model (OAM), which also complies with the KRM specification.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL programming language</a> is a core component of the KRM KCL specification. KCL is a declarative configuration language that allows users to describe the configuration requirements of their applications and associate them with underlying infrastructure. KCL has a rich syntax and semantics that can flexibly describe various configuration needs, such as environment variables, resource limits, dependencies, and more. KCL aims to hide the details of infrastructure and platforms by defining API abstractions, reducing the burden, and managing large-scale configurations across teams without side effects. It provides capabilities to write, combine, and abstract configuration blocks, such as structural definitions, constraints, and logic. In platform engineering practices, KCL is not just a key-value language but a domain-specific language tailored for the platform engineering field.</p><p>Another important feature of the KRM KCL specification is its support for dynamic configuration management. Traditional configuration management tools often rely on static configuration files that require manual modifications and deployments. The KRM KCL specification naturally provides a way to automatically modify configurations, which can be used standalone on the client-side or integrated with Kubernetes through the <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-operator" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Operator</a> to achieve runtime configuration modifications without the need for developing Kubernetes webhooks or writing extensive configuration processing logic.</p><p>In addition to dynamic configuration management, the KRM KCL specification offers several other advantages. Firstly, it is based on Kubernetes and seamlessly integrates with the existing Kubernetes ecosystem. Secondly, the KRM KCL specification provides a rich set of tools and libraries that make it easy for developers to create, test, and maintain configurations. Lastly, the KRM KCL specification adopts open standards, allowing for interoperability with other configuration management tools such as Kubectl, Helm, Kustomize, and more. It possesses the following characteristics:</p><ul><li><strong>Declarative</strong>: Configurations are abstracted and organized in code form, allowing users to view and edit them using editors or IDEs. The code clearly describes various aspects of resources, services, networks, and more.</li><li><strong>Final-state oriented</strong>: It is abstracted and implementation-agnostic, with highly abstracted and domain-specific underlying capabilities. The concrete business logic is written by users in a declarative manner. Users can avoid manual operations and non-uniform patterns introduced by private scripts through a unified description code and GitOps workflow, reducing security risks.</li><li><strong>Stability</strong>: Any modification to configuration code can potentially result in unexpected outcomes, exceptions, or failures. By combining version control and the stability features of the language itself, different versions of configuration code can be switched as needed through Git, with audibility, to meet the needs of development, testing, and production stages. For example, rolling back to a verified version in case of anomalies. Code-based version control effectively prevents configuration drift.</li><li><strong>Reusable and extensible</strong>: Configuration code often exhibits the characteristic of "write once, reuse multiple times". When combined with dynamically parameterized configuration code, the reuse of configurations in different environments and for different users becomes simple. Through integration with standard software supply chains such as OCI, configuration code is treated equally with business code, better achieving Infrastructure as Code (IaC).</li></ul><p>In summary, the KRM KCL specification presents a new paradigm for dynamic configuration management. Built upon KRM and KCL, it offers a more efficient and reliable configuration solution for modern software development. With its dynamic configuration management capabilities, flexible syntax and semantics, and integration with Kubernetes, the KRM KCL specification provides developers with an enhanced configuration management experience in cloud-native application development and microservices architectures.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-to">How to<a href="#how-to" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="krm-kcl-form" src="/assets/images/krm-kcl-form-7ac3b98523882e9e62d3e125f1ecf26b.png" width="2250" height="1208" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the KRM KCL specification, we categorize the behaviors of the KCL configuration model into three main types:</p><ul><li><strong>Mutation</strong>: Takes input KCL parameters params and a KRM list, and outputs a modified KRM list.</li><li><strong>Validation</strong>: Takes input KCL parameters params and a KRM list, and outputs a KRM list and resource validation results.</li><li><strong>Abstraction</strong>: Takes input KCL parameters params and outputs a KRM list.</li></ul><p>Using KCL, we can programmatically achieve the following capabilities:</p><ul><li>Modify resources using KCL, such as adding/modifying label tags or annotation comments based on certain conditions, or injecting sidecar container configurations into all Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM) resources that contain PodTemplates.</li><li>Validate all KRM resources using KCL schemas, such as constraints for launching containers only in a root manner.</li><li>Generate KRM resources using an abstraction model or combine and use different KRM APIs.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the configuration model source can reference OCI, Git, filesystem, and the original KCL code. With the help of KCL IDE and KPM package management tool, we can write models and upload them to OCI Registry for model reuse.

The webhook captures create, apply, and edit operations and executes resources on the configuration associated with each operation using the <code>KCLRun</code> resource. With the KCL Operator, you can automate resource configuration management and security validation in a lightweight manner within a Kubernetes cluster using KCL code, without the need to develop a webhook server to dynamically modify and validate configurations at runtime.</p><p>Additionally, leveraging the modeling and abstraction capabilities of KCL, we can define functional abstractions/compositions for different resource APIs and expose them in the form of KCL schemas. Moreover, KCL schemas can be further automatically generated into OpenAPI schema definitions for other clients in the cluster to call, without the need for manually maintaining complex OpenAPI schema definitions for API abstractions/compositions.</p><p>Here is an example of using the KCL Operator to modify resource annotations.</p><p>Install the KCL Operator:</p><div class="language-shell

With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.</p><p>This section will update the KCL language community's latest developments every two weeks, including features, website updates, and the latest community news, helping everyone better understand the KCL community!</p><p><strong><em>KCL Website: <a href="https://kcl-lang.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://kcl-lang.io</a></em></strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Thank you to all contributors for their outstanding work over the past two weeks (08.10-08.23 2023).

Webhook will capture creation, application, and editing operations, and execute <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/krm-kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCLRun</a> on the configuration associated with each operation, and the KCL programming language can be used to</p><ul><li>Add labels or annotations based on a condition.</li><li>Inject a sidecar container in all KRM resources that contain a <code>PodTemplate</code>.</li><li>Validating all KRM resources using KCL Schema, such as constraints on starting containers only in a root mode.</li><li>Generating KRM resources using an abstract model or combining and using different KRM APIs. </li></ul><p>With KCL Operator, you can automate resource configuration management and security validation in a Kubernetes cluster using lightweight KCL code, without the need to develop a webhook server to dynamically mutate and validate configurations at runtime. </p><p>Furthermore, leveraging KCL's modeling and abstraction capabilities, we can define functionality abstractions/compositions for different resource APIs and expose them in the form of KCL Schema. We can further generate OpenAPI Schema definitions from KCL Schema for other clients in the cluster to use, without manually maintaining complex OpenAPI Schema definitions for API abstractions/compositions. Here is an example of using KCL Operator to modify resource annotations:</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="0-prerequisites">0.

Here is a list of his recent significant contributions:</p><ul><li>🔧 Support for converting JSON/YAML data to KCL configuration: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-go/pull/145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-go/pull/145</a></li><li>🔧 Support for converting Terraform Provider Schema to KCL Schema: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-go/pull/141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-go/pull/141</a></li><li>🔧 Support for converting JsonSchema to KCL Schema: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-go/pull/127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-go/pull/127</a></li></ul><p>The addition of the new Maintainer not only signifies jakezhu9's outstanding technical performance but also reflects the community's high recognition and trust in him.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="experience">Experience<a href="#experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here are jakezhu9's reflections on participating in the KCL community:</p><p>I feel incredibly fortunate to be a part of the KCL community and contribute to the development and growth of the project. From the initial introduction to the KusionStack and KCL, powerful tools and languages in the cloud-native field, to fixing a simple bug in the project, and gradually designing and developing the conversion and generation aspects of KCL, I have not only improved my technical skills but also gained valuable experience in open-source contributions. I have experienced the joy and sense of accomplishment that comes with continuous progress. Every time I see one of my submitted PRs get merged, I feel a great sense of satisfaction. I am grateful to the KCL community and all the seniors and fellow contributors I have encountered along the way who have provided me with ideas and suggestions that have been incredibly helpful during my development process.</p><p>The KCL community is an open, vibrant, and opportune open-source community where developers from different companies and schools with diverse technical backgrounds collaborate and exchange ideas on GitHub and in community meetings. Together, they explore cutting-edge technical solutions and contribute efficient and concise code to the community. Whether you are a novice or an expert in open-source, you can quickly integrate into the community and actively participate. The harmonious and friendly atmosphere in the community makes me feel incredibly welcomed. In the future, I will continue to contribute more to the KCL community, and I warmly welcome interested students to join us and participate in the construction and development of the community together!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="resources">Resources<a href="#resources" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>For more resources, please refer to</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://kcl-lang.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Website</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://kusionstack.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KusionStack Website</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/community/release-policy/roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL 2023 Roadmap</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/milestone/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL v0.6.0 Milestone</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Github Issues</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/orgs/kcl-lang/discussions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Github Discussion</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Community</a></p></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-kcl">What is KCL<a href="#what-is-kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL</a> is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language that enhances the writing of complex configurations, including those for cloud-native scenarios. With its advanced programming language technology and practices, KCL is dedicated to promoting better modularity, scalability, and stability for configurations. It enables simpler logic writing and offers ease of automation APIs and integration with homegrown systems.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-helmfile">What is Helmfile<a href="#what-is-helmfile" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Helmfile is a declarative specification and tool for simplifying and managing Helm Charts. The Helmfile KCL Plugin provides additional functionality to the Helmfile tool, making it more convenient and efficient to use. With the Helmfile KCL Plugin, you can:</p><ul><li>Edit or validate Helm Chart configurations directly on the client-side using non-intrusive hooks. This allows you to separate the data and logic parts of Kubernetes configuration management without needing to fork the upstream Chart to modify internal logic include modifying resource labels/annotations and injecting Sidecar container configurations.</li><li>Validate Kubernetes resources using KCL Schema, define your own abstract models, and share them for reusability.</li></ul><p>In this blog, we will quickly guide you through getting started with the Helmfile KCL Plugin, enabling you to easily manage your Kubernetes Helm Charts.</p><p>We will explain in detail using a simple example. With the Helmfile KCL Plugin, you do not need to install any components related to KCL. You only need the latest version of the Helmfile tool (v0.156.0+) on your local machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="using-the-helmfile-kcl-plugin">Using the Helmfile KCL Plugin<a href="#using-the-helmfile-kcl-plugin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-tool-installation">1. Tool Installation<a href="#1-tool-installation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>First, make sure you have installed the Helmfile client tool. You can follow the instructions in the documentation link below.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-create-the-helmfile-configuration-file">2. Create the Helmfile Configuration File<a href="#2-create-the-helmfile-configuration-file" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Create a file named helmfile.yaml in the root directory of your project and write the configuration using Helmfile syntax. In this file, you can specify the Helm Charts to use, configuration values, and any other functionality supported by Helmfile. Additionally, you can use the features of the KCL Plugin in helmfile.yaml to load configurations and make in-place modifications and validations to the Helm Chart.</p><div class="language-yaml

However, there are not many practical examples related to GitOps. This blog will use KCL, Github and ArgoCD as examples to introduce GitOps in detail, hoping to help everyone practice their own GitOps automation process and simplify DevOps.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-gitops">What is GitOps<a href="#what-is-gitops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>GitOps is a modern way to do continuous delivery. Its core idea is to have a Git repository which contains environmental and application configurations. An automated process is also needed for sync the config to cluster.</p><p>By changing the files in repository, developers can apply the applications automatically. The benefits of applying GitOps include:</p><ul><li>Increased productivity. Continuous delivery can speed up the time of deployment.</li><li>Lower the barrier for developer to deploy. By pushing code instead of container configuration, developers can easily deploy Kubernetes without knowing its internal implementation.</li><li>Trace the change records. Managing the cluster with Git makes every change traceable, enhancing the audit trail.</li><li>Recover the cluster with Git's rollback and branch.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gitops-with-kcl">GitOps with KCL<a href="#gitops-with-kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Benefits of Using KCL and ArgoCD Together:</p><ul><li>KCL can help us <strong>simplify complex Kubernetes deployment configuration files</strong>, reduce the error rate of manually writing YAML files, control configuration constraint checking during compilation, and perceive errors immediately upon writing; At the same time, KCL can be used to eliminate redundant configuration templates, enhance the scalability of multi-environment and multi-tenant configurations, and improve the readability and maintainability of configurations.</li><li>ArgoCD can <strong>automate</strong> the deployment of Kubernetes applications, achieve continuous deployment, and provide comprehensive monitoring and control functions.</li><li>By combining KCL and ArgoCD, deployment efficiency can be improved, errors reduced, and management and monitoring of Kubernetes applications strengthened.</li><li>The combination of KCL and ArgoCD can also help us achieve <strong>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</strong>, simplify application deployment and management, and better implement DevOps principles.</li></ul><p>With GitOps, developer and operation teams can manage application deployment and configuration by modifying KCL code and generating YAML files. The GitOps toolchain will automatically synchronize the changes to the Kubernetes cluster, enabling continuous deployment and ensuring consistency. If there are issues, the GitOps toolchain can be used to quickly rollback.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow">Workflow<a href="#workflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We hope to implement the end-to-end application development process by using containers, Continuous Integration (CI) for generation, and GitOps for Continuous Deployment (CD). In this scheme, we use a <strong>Flask application</strong> and <strong>Github Actions</strong> as examples.</p><blockquote><p>Note: You can use any containerized application and different CI systems such as <strong>Gitlab CI</strong>, <strong>Jenkins CI</strong>, etc. in this solution.</p></blockquote><p>We divide the Python Flask application code and configuration code into two repos, <em>to achieve the separation of concerns of different roles, such as developers and operation and maintenance teams</em></p><ul><li>App code repo: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo</a></li><li>Config manifest repo: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo-kcl-manifests" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/flask-demo-kcl-manifests</a></li></ul><p>The overall workflow is as follows:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="workflow" src="/assets/images/workflow-e95f2993e77762a23be96013944a68d7.jpg" width="1048" height="624" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol><li>Pull application code from Github.</li><li>Develop and submit application code to the GitHub repository.</li><li>Trigger GitHub Actions to compile the application code, generate container images, and push the container images to the Docker Hub container registry.</li><li>Trigger GitHub Actions to synchronously update the Kubernetes manifest files defined by KCL based on the version of the container image in the <code>docker.io</code> container registry.</li><li>ArgoCD obtains Kubernetes manifest changes and updates deployment to Kubernetes cluster.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="steps">Steps<a href="#steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="0-prerequisite">0.

The overall workflow is as follows:</p><ul><li>Develop application code and submit it to the GitHub repository to trigger CI (using Python Flask web application as an example).</li></ul><p><img

We have provided common code assistance features in the IDE, such as highlight, goto definition, completion, outline, hover, diagnostics, and more.</p><ul><li><strong>Syntax Highlight:</strong><img loading="lazy" alt="Highlight" src="/assets/images/Highlight-7e1f5208ba57f3ebe9926efba8e270a2.png" width="1312" height="782" class="img_ev3q"></li><li><strong>Goto Definition:</strong> Goto definition of schema, variable, schema attribute, and import pkg.

LSP stands for Language Server Protocol, which is a protocol for programming language tools that was introduced by Microsoft in 2016. It is easy to understand LSP with a picture on the VSCode website.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="LSP" src="/assets/images/lsp-4d40c09909e7dc972f884e4eefea5a92.png" width="1162" height="538" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By LSP, IDE can communicate with the language server which runs on the backend through the JSON-RPC protocol. The language server can provide capabilities such as code analysis, completion, syntax highlighting, and goto definition. Based on LSP, developers can migrate between different editors and IDEs, reducing the development of language tools from M (number of languages) * N (number of editors/IDEs) to M + N.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-rewrite-it-in-rust">Why rewrite it in Rust？<a href="#why-rewrite-it-in-rust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The KCL compiler and other tools were originally implemented in Python, and we rewrote its compiler in Rust for performance reasons. After that, we gradually rewrote other tools of KCL, such as testing and formatting tools. In this update, we also rewrote the LSP in consideration of performance issues.</p><p>In the past, when the Python version LSP server was processing some complex scenarios (over 200 files), for a request of goto definition, the server-side took more than about 6 seconds from receiving the request to calculating the result and responding.  It is almost unavailable. Since the implementation of the server side is mainly based on the lexical analysis and semantic analysis of the front-end and middle-end of the compiler. After we rewrite it in Rust, the performance of this part has been improved by 20 and 40 times, and the remarkable result is that the response time of the server has been greatly improved. Boost, for the same scenario, the response time is reduced to around 100 milliseconds. For some simple scenarios, the response time is only a few milliseconds, which makes the user feel indifferent.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="design-of-kcl-lsp">Design of KCL LSP<a href="#design-of-kcl-lsp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The KCL LSP is designed as follows：
<img loading="lazy" alt="KCL-LSP" src="/assets/images/kcl-LSP-5466adee5a10481b8f41cb615977a034.png" width="627" height="421" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The main process can be divided into several stages:</p><ol><li>Initiate a connection and set the LSP capability. In IDE, when opening a specific file (e.g., *.k  for KCL), the IDE will run the local kcl_language_server binary. This binary is distributed with KCL and installed in KCL's bin directory. After the Server starts, it will start a standard IO Connection and wait for the initialization request sent by the IDE Client. After receiving the initialization request, the server will define the information and capabilities of the server and return it to the client to complete the initial connection of the LSP.</li><li>After the connection is established, the server will start a polling function to continuously receive LSP messages from the client, such as <code>Notification</code> (open/close/change/delete files, etc.) and <code>Request</code> (goto definition, hover, etc.), as well as messages from the server itself the Task. And uniformly encapsulated into an event (Event) and handed over to the next step for processing.</li><li>For different events, follow the steps below:</li></ol><div class="language-Rust codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-Rust codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/// Handles an event from one of the many sources that the language server subscribes to.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">fn handle_event(&amp;mut self, event: Event) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    // 1.

In the sub-function, it will be further distributed to the final processing function based on the type of request or notification, such as processing file changes, processing goto definition requests, etc. These functions will analyze the semantic model (AST, symbol table, error information, etc.) compiled based on the front-end of the compiler, calculate and generate the Response (such as the target position of the goto definition request).</p><p>3.2 Change processing: When the user modifies the code or changes the file, the corresponding Notification will be sent. In the previous step of processing, the changes are saved in the virtual file system (VFS). The server side will recompile according to the new source code and save the new semantic model for processing the next request.</p><p>3.3 Diagnostics: the diagnostics here do not refer to LSP server, but to the grammatical and semantic errors and warnings when compiling KCL code. The IDE/editor does not have a request to get these errors, but the LSP server actively sends Diagnostics. Therefore, after the change, the error information is updated on the client side synchronously</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problems">Problems<a href="#problems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-why-do-we-need-a-virtual-file-system">1. Why do we need a virtual file system?<a href="#1-why-do-we-need-a-virtual-file-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In the original design, the use of a virtual file system was not considered. Each time we fetch the source code from the file system, compile and analyze it. For some "static" tasks, such as goto definition, you can save the code to the file system after changing, and then find some variables definitions. Cooperating with the automatic save of VS Code, there is no obvious gap in user experience. However, for tasks such as completion, the input of <code>.</code> on the IDE/editor will trigger a file change notification and a request for completion, but the code has not been saved in the file system. Therefore, the semantic model cannot be analyzed correctly. Therefore, we realized the virtual file system with the creation of Rust Analyzer's vfs and changed the compilation entry from the file path to the source code. After the client enters the code, the file change notification will first update the virtual file system, recompile the file, and then process the completion request.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-how-to-deal-with-incomplete-code">2. How to deal with incomplete code?<a href="#2-how-to-deal-with-incomplete-code" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Another big problem we encountered was how to deal with incomplete code. Likewise, for "static" tasks, e.g., goto definition, the code can be assumed to be complete and correct. But for the request of completion, such as the following code, I hope to complete the function of the string after entering <code>.</code>.For the compilation process, the second line is an incomplete code that cannot be compiled into a normal AST tree.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">s: str = "hello kcl"</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">len = s.</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>To this end, we have implemented a variety of syntactic and semantic error recovery in KCL compilation, ensuring that the compilation process can always produce a complete AST and symbol table. In this example, we added an empty AST node as a placeholder, so that the second line can generate a complete AST. When processing the completion request, it will complete the function name, schema attr or the schema name defined in pkg according to the type of <code>s</code> and other semantic information.</p><blockquote><p>Rust Analyzer architecture:</p><p>Architecture Invariant: parsing never fails, the parser produces (T, Vec<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->Error<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->) rather than Result<!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->T, Error<!-- -->&gt;<!-- -->.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>KCL's IDE extension has already implemented capabilities such as highlighting, goto definition, completion, outline, hovering, and diagnostics. These features improve the development efficiency of KCL users. However, as an IDE extension, its functionality is not complete enough. In the future, we will continue to improve its capabilities. Future work has the following aspects:</p><ul><li>More capabilities: Provide more capabilities, such as code refactoring, error quick fix, code fmt, etc., to further improve capabilities and improve development efficiency</li><li>More IDE Integration: At present, although KCL provides LSP, it only integrates with VS Code. In the future, KCL users will be provided with more choices based on the capabilities of LSP.</li><li>Integration of AI: At present, ChatGPT is popular all over the Internet. We are also exploring the combination of AI×KCL to provide a more intelligent R&amp;D experience.</li></ul><p>In summary, we will continue to improve and optimize KCL's IDE extension to make it more powerful and practical. Bring more convenient and efficient development experience to KCL users.

And it also allows applications to be composed of heterogeneous components and technologies.</p><p>This pattern is named <code>Sidecar</code> because it resembles a Sidecar attached to a motorcycle. The Sidecar connects to a parent application and provides support functions for the application. The Sidecar also shares the same lifecycle as the parent application, being created and retired alongside the parent. The Sidecar pattern is sometimes referred to as the sidepick pattern and is a decomposition pattern.</p><p>This series of articles will show the usage of the <code>Sidecar</code> pattern and how to use the <code>Sidecar</code> pattern by KCL.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-cloud-native-minimalist-web-services">A Cloud-Native Minimalist Web Services<a href="#a-cloud-native-minimalist-web-services" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>At first, we could start a web service in our kubernetes environment.

heading">​</a></h2><p>Containers have now become a popular packaging technology, where various teams can build, publish and run programs in a unified way, and even manage various resources through containers. So a container is more like a product with its own runtime, release cycle, documentation, API, etc. A good container/product is responsible for solving only one problem, and maintaining the KISS principle allows the container itself to be extremely reusable and replaceable.</p><p>It is reusability that makes the modern build process more agile and efficient. But reusable containers are generally single-function, and we often need to extend the functionality of containers, as well as the need for more collaboration between containers.</p><p>The Sidecar can be added lots of trailers without modifying the main motorcycle, and accordingly the <code>Sidecar</code> pattern can extend and enhance the existing main container functions without modifying the main container.</p><p>There is a rule in object-oriented programming that "combination is better than inheritance, use more combination and less inheritance", so <code>Sidecar</code> is also a recommended pattern to use. Because of the advantages of the Sidecar pattern, it has recently been used in a lot of cloud-native scenarios. For example, it can be used to encrypt communication between Pods through a service mesh or to act as a database proxy. Sidecar containers can be used for log forwarding (e.g., <code>fluentd</code>), Service Mesh (e.g., <code>Istio</code>, <code>Linkerd</code>), proxying (e.g., <code>Docker Ambassador</code>), health checking (to check if certain components are working properly), and other auxiliary tasks (such as copying files or downloading files).</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In this article, we briefly introduce and demonstrate the <code>Sidecar</code> pattern, while comparing the relationship between <code>Sidecar</code> pattern and the combinatorial programming pattern in the context of traditional object-oriented programming ideas. the advantages of the <code>Sidecar</code> pattern are not only in the harmless enhancement of the main container, but also in the more flexible ability to dynamically adjust the main container capability.</p><p>In later articles, we will try to simplify writing <code>Sidecar</code> configurations by modern cloud-native configuration languages such as <code>KCL</code>. Extending existing configuration based on <code>Sidecar</code> by dynamically injecting and modifying it through <code>KCL</code>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Helm is an imperative templating tool for managing Kubernetes packages called charts. Charts are a templated version of your yaml manifests with a subset of Go Templating mixed throughout, as well it is a package manager for kubernetes that can package, configure, and deploy/apply the helm charts onto kubernetes clusters.</p><p>In KCL, the user can directly write the configuration instead of template files with more tools and IDE plugin support that needs to be modified in the corresponding code in the corresponding place, eliminating the cost of reading basic YAML. At the same time, the user can reuse the configuration fragments by code, avoiding massive copying and pasting of YAML configuration. The information density is higher, and it is not easy to make mistakes through KCL.</p><p>A classic example of helm chart configuration management is used to explain the differences between Helm and KCL in Kubernetes resource configuration management.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="helm">Helm<a href="#helm" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Helm has the concepts of <code>values.yaml</code> and <code>template</code>.

Helm, KCL reduces the number of configuration files and code lines by means of code generation on the basis of configuration reuse and coverage, And like Helm, it is a pure client solution, which can move the configuration and policy verification to the left as far as possible without additional dependency or burden on the cluster, or even without a real Kubernetes cluster.</p><p>Helm can define reusable templates in the <code>.tpl</code> file and support other templates to reference it. However, only defined templates can be reused. In a complex Helm chart project, we need to define a lot of additional basic templates. Compared with the cumbersome writing method of Helm, all contents in KCL are variables. No additional syntax is required to specify templates. Any variables can be referenced to each other.</p><p>In addition, there are a large number of <code>{{- include }}</code>, <code>nindent</code> and <code>toYaml</code> tag characters that have nothing to do with actual logic in Helm. You need to calculate spaces and indents at each reference. In KCL, there are fewer useless codes, and there is no need for too many <code>{{*}}</code> to mark code blocks. The information density is higher, and the indentation and space have been completely liberated.</p><p>In fact, KCL and Helm are not antagonistic. We can even use KCL to write HelmRelease templates and provide programmable extension capabilities for existing Helm chart to write YAML validators.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="future-plan">Future Plan<a href="#future-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We also expect that KCL models and constraints can be managed as a package (this package has only KCL files). For example, the Kubernetes models and constraints can be used out of the box. Users can generate configurations or verify existing configurations, and can simply extend the models and constraints users want through KCL inheritance.</p><p>At this stage, you can use tools such as Git or <a href="https://github.com/oras-project/oras" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OCI Registry As Storage (ORAS)</a> to manage KCL configuration versions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="more-documents">More Documents<a href="#more-documents" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li>KCL Github Repo: <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl</a></li><li>KCL Website: <a href="https://kcl-lang.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://kcl-lang.io</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

The configuration can be merged or overwritten through file-level YAML configuration with multiple strategies. In Kustomize, users need to know more about the content and location to be changed, For basic YAML with complex recursion too deep, it may not be easy to match Kustomize files through selectors.</p><p>In KCL, the user can directly write the configuration that needs to be modified in the corresponding code in the corresponding place, eliminating the cost of reading basic YAML. At the same time, the user can reuse the configuration fragments by code, avoiding massive copying and pasting of YAML configuration. The information density is higher, and it is not easy to make mistakes through KCL.</p><p>A classic example of Kustomize multi-environment configuration management is used to explain the differences between Kustomize and KCL in Kubernetes resource configuration management.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="kustomize">Kustomize<a href="#kustomize" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Kustomize has the concepts of <code>base</code> and <code>overlay</code>. In general, base and overlay are general a directory including a <code>kustomization.yaml</code> file. One base directory can be used by multiple overlay directories.</p><p>We can execute the following command line to obtain a typical Kustomize project</p><ul><li>Create a base directory and create a deployment resource</li></ul><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># Create a directory to hold the base</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">mkdir</span><span class="token plain"> base</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:#999988;font-style:italic"># Create a base/deployment.yaml</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:#d73a49">cat</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">EOF</span><span class="token string bash punctuation" style="color:#393A34"> </span><span class="token string bash punctuation operator" style="color:#393A34">&gt;</span><span class="token string bash punctuation" style="color:#393A34"> base/deployment.yaml</span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">apiVersion: apps/v1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">kind: Deployment</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">metadata:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">  name: ldap</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">  labels:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">    app: ldap</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">spec:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">  replicas: 1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">  selector:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">    matchLabels:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">      app: ldap</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">  template:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">    metadata:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">      labels:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">        app: ldap</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">    spec:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">      containers:</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">        -

<code>metadata</code>, <code>spec</code> and other attributes of a Kubernetes <code>Deployment</code> resource, and assign the corresponding contents respectively. In particular, we assign <code>metadata.labels</code> to <code>spec.selector.matchLabels</code> and <code>spec.template.metadata.labels</code>. It can be seen that the data structure defined by KCL is more compact than Kustomize or YAML, and configuration reuse can be realized by defining local variables.</p><p>In KCL, we can dynamically receive external parameters through conditional statements and the <code>option</code> builtin function, and set different configuration values for different environments to generate resources. For example, for the above code, we wrote a conditional statement and entered a dynamic parameter named <code>env</code>. When <code>env</code> is <code>prod</code>, we will overwrite the <code>replicas</code> attribute from <code>1</code> to <code>6</code>, and make some adjustments to the volume configuration named <code>ldap-data</code>, such as changing the <code>emptyDir</code> attribute to <code>None</code>, and adding the configuration value of <code>gcePersistentDisk</code>.</p><p>We can use the following

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-kcl">What is KCL<a href="#what-is-kcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL</a> is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language. KCL improves the writing of numerous complex configurations, such as cloud-native scenarios, through its mature programming language technology and practice. It is dedicated to building better modularity, scalability, and stability around configurations, simpler logic writing, faster automation, and great built-in or API-driven integrations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-kcl-go-sdk">What is KCL Go SDK?<a href="#what-is-kcl-go-sdk" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>kclvm is a runtime library for the KCL language that provides a programming interface for interacting with the KCL compiler. It is a client library that can be used to perform various operations on KCL source code such as execution and formatting. KCL Go SDK is a Go language wrapper for kclvm that provides an SDK for KCL language integration in cloud-native environments.</p><p>The current version of <code>KCL Go SDK</code> is built on top of the kclvm json2 RPC API, which means that it uses the same API as other language KCL clients to interact with KCL source code. The way it works is similar to other language KCL SDKs, but it provides a more user-friendly Go language style wrapper.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-problems-does-the-new-version-of-kcl-go-sdk-solve">What problems does the new version of KCL Go SDK solve?<a href="#what-problems-does-the-new-version-of-kcl-go-sdk-solve" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>KCL is closely related to the cloud-native domain as a configuration language, while on the other hand, Go has become the de facto standard programming language for cloud-native domains. In this context, the development of a Go SDK for the KCL compiler to directly interact with Go was necessary, which is the reason for the creation of <code>KCL Go SDK</code>.</p><p>The initial version of the KCL compiler and runtime were written in Python, and the runtime for the first version of the KCL language had a lot of room for improvement in terms of performance and security due to the performance issues and characteristics of the dynamic nature of the Python language. In light of security and efficiency considerations, later versions of the KCL compiler were written in the Rust programming language. As a result, the new version of <code>KCL Go SDK</code> is based on rust-implemented kclvm packaging, eliminating Python dependencies, simplifying installation, and optimizing the user experience.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="quickly-experience-kcl-go-sdk-via-the-command-line">Quickly experience KCL Go SDK via the command line<a href="#quickly-experience-kcl-go-sdk-via-the-command-line" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><code>KCL Go SDK</code> provides a built-in command line tool named <code>kcl-go</code> ,which supports one-click installation through <code>go install</code>. The local Go version must be 1.18+ and the complete CGO toolchain is required.</p><p>Simply run:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

Kubernetes community using a unified programming interface. Writing a few lines of KCL code can non-intrusively complete the mutation and validation of existing Kustomize YAML and Helm Charts.</p><p>For example, writing a small amount of KCL code to modify resource labels/annotations, injecting sidecar container configuration, and using KCL schema to verify resources.</p><p>Below is a detailed explanation of the integration of KCL using the Kustomize tool. There is no need to install any KCL-related binaries to use the Kustomize KCL plugin, just install the Kustomize tool locally.</p><p>Firstly, execute the following command to obtain a Kustomize YAML

This release is mainly aimed at improving the convenience and stability of KCL language writing, improving error information, and supporting more platforms including Windows version and more download methods. In KCL v0.4.5, users can eliminate more configuration templates by writing fewer KCL codes. In the new version, preliminary KCL Playground support is provided, which can be used to write and run KCL code online without installation. In addition, this release also includes many compiler error information optimization and bug fixes.</p><p>You can visit the <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl/releases/tag/v0.4.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL release page</a> or the <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL website</a> to get KCL binary download link and more detailed release information.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL</a> is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional language.

In addition, this release provides the latest <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kclvm-py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Python SDK</a>, which can be used for Python users to directly integrate KCL.

KCL improves the writing of a large number of complex configurations through mature programming language technology and practice, and is committed to building better modularity, scalability and stability around configuration, simpler logic writing, fast automation and good ecological extensionality.</p><p>This blog will introduce the recent developments of KCL community to readers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="features">Features<a href="#features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="customize-yaml-manifest-output">Customize YAML Manifest Output<a href="#customize-yaml-manifest-output" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In previous KCL versions, the style of YAML output is hard coded in the KCL compiler, and users can set the <code>__settings__</code> meta attribute with different values to determine the YAML output style, which brings high complexity. Therefore, in version 0.4.4, we provide a system module function for developers to easily customize the YAML output style. The signature of this function is as follows:</p><div class="language-python codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-python codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">manifests</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">.</span><span class="token plain">yaml_stream</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">(</span><span class="token plain">values</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">[</span><span class="token builtin">any</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">]</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">,</span><span class="token plain"> opts</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token builtin">str</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">:</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">{</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    sort_keys </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token boolean" style="color:#36acaa">False</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    ignore_private </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token boolean" style="color:#36acaa">True</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    ignore_none </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token boolean" style="color:#36acaa">False</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    sep </span><span class="token operator" style="color:#393A34">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token string" style="color:#e3116c">"---"</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">}</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:#393A34">)</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>This function is used to serialize the KCL object list into YAML output with the <code>---</code> separator.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Rust has quietly become one of the most popular programming languages. As an popular emerging system language, Rust has many great characteristics, such as its memory security mechanism, performance close to that of C/C++, an excellent development community and helpful documentation, tool chains and IDEs. In this blog, we will introduce the process of using Rust for a rewrite and gradually implementing the production environment, as well as the reasons for choosing Rust, any issues we have encountered, and the results of the rewrite.</p><p>The project we are using Rust to develop is called <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL</a>. KCL is an open-source, constraint-based record and functional programming language. It leverages mature programming language technology and practice to facilitate the writing of many complex configurations. KCL is designed to improve modularity, scalability, and stability around configuration, simplify logic writing, speed up automation and create a thriving extension ecosystem. To learn more about specific KCL usage scenarios, please refer to the <a href="https://kcl-lang.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL website</a>. This blog will not go into too much detail about that.</p><p>KCL was written in Python before. After carefully evaluating the user experience, performance and stability, we decided to rewrite KCL in Rust, and the following benefits were obtained:</p><ul><li>Rust's powerful compilation checks and error handling led to fewer bugs.</li><li>There was a 66% improvement in end-to-end compilation and execution performance.</li><li>The language front-end parser performance improved by up to 20 times.</li><li>The language semantic analyzer performance improved by up to 40 times.</li><li>The average memory usage of the language compiler during compilation was roughly half of the original Python version.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-problems-have-we-encountered">What problems have we encountered<a href="#what-problems-have-we-encountered" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The compiler, build system or runtime uses Rust to do similar things in technology like projects of the same type in the community <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deno</a>, <a href="https://github.com/swc-project/swc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">swc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vercel/turbo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turbopack</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rustc</a>. We used Rust to completely build the front, middle and runtime of the compiler, and achieved some results, but we did not do this about a year ago.</p><p>A year ago, we used Python to build the entire KCL compiler implementation, which initially ran well due to Python’s ease of use, rich ecosystem, and the team's high research and development efficiency. However, as the codebase and number of engineers grew, code maintenance became increasingly difficult. To counter this, we enforced the usage of Python type annotations and employed stricter linting tools, as well as achieving &gt;90% code test coverage. Yet, runtime errors such as empty Python objects and missing attributes remained, and refactoring had to be done with caution.</p><p>As KCL users are mostly developers, any mishaps in the language or compiler internals were unacceptable, leading to a range of issues with user experience. Furthermore, programs written in Python had slow startup times, and their performance did not meet the efficiency demands of automating the online compilation and execution. Therefore, a compiler written in Python was unable to adequately meet use requirements.</p><p>Consequently, we decided to rewrite KCL in Rust to not only improve user experience, but to also benefit from Rust’s powerful compilation checks and error handling. This led to a 66% improvement in end-to-end compilation and execution performance, as well as a 20- and 40-fold improvement in the language front-end and semantic analyser performance, respectively. The average memory usage of the compiler during compilation was also roughly halved.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-use-rust">Why use Rust<a href="#why-use-rust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>We chose Rust for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>We implemented a simple programming language stack virtual machine in Python, Go, and Rust and conducted a performance comparison, Rust was adopted under comprehensive consideration as Go and Rust had similar performance whereas Python had a large performance gap. The details of the stack virtual machine code implemented by the three languages are here: <a href="https://github.com/Peefy/StackMachine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Peefy/StackMachine</a>.</li><li>Rust has been widely utilized for compilers or runtimes of programming languages, especially in front-end infrastructure projects, and is present in various fields such as infrastructure, database, search engine, network, cloud-native, UI, and embedded systems, ensuring its feasibility and stability.</li><li>Considering that the subsequent project development will involve the direction of blockchain and smart contract, and a large number of blockchain and smart contract projects in the community are written by Rust.</li><li>Rust provides better performance and stability, making the system easier to maintain and more robust, while allowing developers to expose C APIs through FFI for multilingual use and expansion.</li><li>Rust's friendly support for Web Assembly (WASM) is extremely beneficial for the development of blockchain and smart contract projects.</li></ul><p>Based on the above reasons, we chose Rust instead of Go. In the whole rewriting process, we found that Rust's comprehensive quality is impressive because it not only provides high performance but also a sufficient abstraction, although there is some cost in certain language features such as lifetime. Nevertheless, its ecology is not as rich as other languages.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-difficulties-in-using-rust">What are the difficulties in using Rust<a href="#what-are-the-difficulties-in-using-rust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Although we decided to rewrite the entire KCL project with Rust, most team members have no experience in writing a certain project with Rust, and I has only learned <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rust Programming Language</a>. I vaguely remember that I gave up when I learned about intelligent pointers such as <code>Rc</code> and <code>RefCell</code>. At that time, I didn't expect that there would be anything similar to C++ in Rust.</p><p>The risk of utilizing Rust is mainly the expense of learning the language, which is evidently discussed in a multitude of Rust blogs. Seeing that the overall structure of the KCL project had not been altered considerably, and some modules' designs and their code had been greatly improved for Rust, the entire rewrite was accomplished through a process of mastering Rust whilst practicing. When we set out to use Rust to create the whole project, time was spent on knowledge querying, compilation and debugging. As the project advanced, however, the main challenges that arose from utilizing Rust were mainly the transformation of our mindsets, as well as the efficiency of development.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mental-transformation">Mental transformation<a href="#mental-transformation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>First of all, the syntax and semantics of Rust well absorb and integrate the concepts related to the type system in functional programming, such as the Abstract Algebraic Type (ADT). In addition, there is no concept related to "inheritance" in Rust. If you can't understand it well, even ordinary structure definitions in other languages may take a lot of time in Rust. For example, the following Python code may be defined like this in Rust.</p><ul><li>Python</li></ul><div class="language-python codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block"

itself. The Rust compiler will often cause developers to "run into a wall", such as borrowing check errors. Especially for the KCL compiler, its core structure is the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which is a recursive and nested tree structure.</p><p>It is sometimes difficult to give consideration to the relationship between variable variability and borrowing check in Rust, Just like the scope structure <code>Scope</code> defined in KCL compiler, for scenarios with circular references, it is used to display the interdependence of data that needs to be aware of, while making extensive use of intelligent pointer structures commonly used in Rust such as <code>Rc</code>, <code>RefCell</code> and <code>Weak</code>.</p><div class="language-rust codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-rust codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/// A Scope maintains a set of objects and links to its containing</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">/// (parent) and contained (children) scopes.

Initially, if the team members have not been exposed to concepts such as functional programming and related coding practices, the development speed will be much slower than that of languages such as Python, Go, and Java. Nevertheless, once they become familiarized with the conventional methods and best practices of the Rust standard library, as well as the common fixes for Rust compiler errors, the development efficiency will be dramatically boosted, and they will be able to compose high-quality, safe, and efficient code naturally.</p><p>For instance, I ran into a Rust lifetime error in the following code. After troubleshooting for a lengthy duration, it became apparent that the lifetime inconsistency was due to neglecting to label lifetime parameters. Additionally, Rust’s lifetime is combined with concepts such as type system, scope, ownership, and borrowing inspection, resulting in a higher cost and complexity of understanding, with error reporting information often not as clear-cut as type errors. The lifetime inconsistency error reporting information can sometimes be somewhat inflexible, which may lead to a costly troubleshooting procedure. Of course, efficiency will be improved with increasing familiarity with the pertinent concepts.</p><div class="language-rust codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#393A34;--prism-background-color:#f6f8fa"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-rust codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">struct Data&lt;'a&gt; {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    b: &amp;'a u8,</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">// func2 omit lifecycle parameters, and func2 does not.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">// The lifecycle of func2 will be deduced as '_ by the Rust compiler by default,</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">// which may lead to lifetime mismatch error.</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">impl&lt;'a&gt; Data&lt;'a&gt; {</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    fn func1(&amp;self) -&gt; Data&lt;'a&gt; {Data { b: &amp;0 }}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">    fn func2(&amp;self) -&gt; Data {Data { b: &amp;0 }}</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#393A34"><span class="token plain">}</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rewrite-revenue-ratio-using-rust">Rewrite revenue ratio using Rust<a href="#rewrite-revenue-ratio-using-rust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>After spending several months using Rust to completely rewrite and steadily deploy the KCL project into a production environment, we have looked back on the whole process and found it highly rewarding.</p><p>From a technical point of view, the rewrite process not only trained us to quickly learn a new programming language and its associated knowledge, but it also enabled us to put them into practice. The whole rewrite process also made us reflect on the unrational design of the KCL compiler and modify it accordingly. For a programming language, this is a long-cycle project. We have learned that such a compiler system should be more stable, and secure, with legible code, fewer bugs, and better performance.</p><p>Although not all modules achieved a 40-fold improvement in performance (due to memory deep copy operations being the main bottleneck of some modules, such as the KCL runtime), I still think it is particularly beneficial. With enough experience in Rust, mental and development efficiency are no longer limiting factors.</p><p>Overall, although our team encountered obstacles while using Rust to rewrite the KCL project, we eventually succeeded. We have acquired invaluable knowledge and experience in the process, which will be immensely beneficial in the future.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I personally think that the most important thing after using Rust to rewrite the project is whether I have learned a new programming language or whether Rust is very popular and we have written many fancy codes using Rust. The stability, startup-time, and automation-efficiency of the KCL compiler and language is significantly improved. Furthermore, with Rust's non-GC, high-performance, improved error handling, memory management, and lack of abstraction, the performance of KCL improves substantially as compared to other languages in similar fields. In short, the users of KCL are the biggest beneficiaries of the improvements made possible by Rust.</p><p>If you are interested in the KCL project, wish to use KCL for your personal use cases, or want to use Rust to participate in an open-source project, welcome to visit <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/community</a> to join our community to participate in discussion and co construction 👏👏👏。</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="reference">Reference<a href="#reference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Peefy/StackMachine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/Peefy/StackMachine</a></li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/sunface/rust-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/sunface/rust-course</a></li><li><a href="https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-can-be-difficult-to-learn-and-frustrating-but-its-also-the-most-exciting-thing-in-software-development-in-a-long-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.influxdata.com/blog/rust-can-be-difficult-to-learn-and-frustrating-but-its-also-the-most-exciting-thing-in-software-development-in-a-long-time/</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

The general language is usually overkill, that is, it goes far beyond the problems that need to be solved. There are various security problems in the general language, such as the ability boundary problem (starting local threads, accessing IO, network, code infinitive looping and other security risks). For example, in the music field, there are special notes to express music, which is convenient for learning and communication, It can not be expressed clearly in general language.</p><p>In addition, because of its various styles of the general language, which has the cost of unified maintenance, management and automation. The general language is usually used to write the client runtime, which is a continuation of the server runtime. It is not suitable for writing configurations that are independent of the runtime, and it is compiled into binary and started from the process finally. Besides, the stability and scalability are not easy to control. However, the configuration language often be used to write data, which is combined with simple logic, and it describes the expected final result, which is then consumed by the compiler or engine.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-kcl-core-features-and-use-cases">2. KCL Core Features and Use Cases<a href="#2-kcl-core-features-and-use-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>The core features of KCL are its <strong>modeling</strong> and <strong>constraint</strong> capabilities, and the basic functions of KCL revolve around the two core features. In addition, KCL follows the user-centric configuration concept to design its basic functions, which can be understood from two aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Domain model-centric configuration view</strong>: With the rich features of KCL language and <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/tools/cli/openapi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL OpenAPI</a> tools, we can directly integrate a wide range of well-designed models in the community into KCL (such as the K8s resource model). We can also design and implement our own KCL models or libraries according to different scenarios, forming a complete set of domain models for other configuration end users to use.</li><li><strong>End user-centric configuration view</strong>: With KCL's code encapsulation, abstraction and reuse capabilities, the model architecture can be further abstracted and simplified (for example, the K8s resource model is abstracted into an application-centered server model) to <strong>minimize the end user configuration input</strong>, simplify the user's configuration interface, and facilitate manual or automatic API modification.</li></ul><p>No matter what configuration view is centered on, for configuration code, there are requirements for configuration data constraints, such as type constraints, required/optional constraints on configuration attributes, range constraints, and immutability constraints. This is also one of the core issues KCL is committed to solving. KCL mainly contains the core features shown in Fig. 5.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/05-kcl-core-feature-3a2f7be7eb09e776258cf83ffc279cbb.png" width="892" height="878" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fig. 5: KCL core features.</p><ul><li><strong>Easy-to-use</strong>: Originated from high-level languages ​​such as Python and Golang, incorporating functional language features with low side effects.</li><li><strong>Well-designed</strong>: Independent Spec-driven syntax, semantics, runtime and system modules design.</li><li><strong>Quick modeling</strong>: <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour#schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schema</a>-centric configuration types and modular abstraction.</li><li><strong>Rich capabilities</strong>: Configuration with type, logic and policy based on <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour#config-operations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Config</a>, <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour#schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Schema</a>, <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour#function" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lambda</a>, <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour#rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rule</a>.</li><li><strong>Stability</strong>: Configuration stability built on <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour/#type-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">static type system</a>, <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour/#validation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">constraints</a>, and <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour#rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rules</a>.</li><li><strong>Scalability</strong>: High scalability through <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour/#-operators-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">automatic merge mechanism</a> of isolated config blocks.</li><li><strong>Fast automation</strong>: Gradient automation scheme of <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour/#kcl-cli-variable-override" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRUD APIs</a>, <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/xlang-api/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multilingual SDKs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language plugin</a></li><li><strong>High performance</strong>: High compile time and runtime performance using Rust &amp; C and <a href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LLVM</a>, and support compilation to native code and <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASM</a>.</li><li><strong>API affinity</strong>: Native support API ecological specifications such as <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/kcl-openapi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenAPI</a>, Kubernetes CRD, Kubernetes YAML spec.</li><li><strong>Development friendly</strong>: Friendly development experiences with rich <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/tools/cli/kcl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">language tools</a> (Format, Lint, Test, Vet, Doc, etc.) and <a href="https://github.com/kcl-lang/vscode-kcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IDE plugins</a>.</li><li><strong>Safety &amp; maintainable</strong>: Domain-oriented, no system-level functions such as native threads and IO, low noise and security risk, easy maintenance and governance.</li><li><strong>Rich multi-language SDK</strong>: <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/xlang-api/go-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go</a>, <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/xlang-api/python-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a> and <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/xlang-api/rest-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST APIs</a> meet different scenarios and application use prelude.</li><li><strong>Production-ready</strong>: Widely used in production practice of platform engineering and automation at Ant Group.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/06-kcl-code-design-1993576ecb719dcef493c7ba08a1051c.png" width="520" height="394" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fig. 6: KCL core design.</p><p>For more language design and capabilities, see <a href="https://kcl-lang.io/docs/reference/lang/tour" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KCL Documents</a>. Although KCL is not a general language, it has corresponding application scenarios. As shown in Fig. 6, developers can write <strong>config</strong>, <strong>schema</strong>, <strong>function</strong> and <strong>rule</strong> through KCL, where config is used to define data, schema is used to describe the model definition of data, rule is used to validate data, and schema and rule can also be combined to use models and constraints that fully describe data, In addition, we can also use the lambda pure function in KCL to organize data code, encapsulate common code, and call it directly when needed.</p><p>For use cases, KCL can perform structured K-V data validation complex configuration model definition and abstraction, strong constraint verification to avoid configuration errors, automation integration and engineering expansion. These features and use cases are described below.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="21-validation-of-structured-data">2.1 Validation of Structured Data<a href="#21-validation-of-structured-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>As shown in Fig 7, KCL supports format validation of JSON/YAML data. As a configuration language, KCL covers almost all features of OpenAPI in terms of validation. In KCL, the configuration data can be constrained by a structure definition. At the same time, it supports user-defined constraint rules through check blocks, and writing validation expressions in the schema to verify and constrain the attributes defined in the schema. The check expression can be used to clearly and simply verify whether the input JSON/YAML meets the corresponding schema structure definition and check constraints.</p><p><img loading="lazy"

Type and value definitions are separated. Type derivation and type checking at compile time are supported. Static types can not only analyze most type errors at compile time in advance, but also reduce the performance loss of dynamic type checking at runtime. In addition, the attributes of the KCL schema are forced to be not null, which can effectively avoid configuration omissions.</li><li>When KCL configurations to be exported are declared, their types and values cannot change. This static feature ensures that the configuration will not be tampered with at will.</li><li>KCL supports further ensuring stability through the built-in validation rules of the structure. For example, Fig. 12 shows that the KCL code defines the constraints for <code>containerPort</code>, <code>services</code>, and <code>volumes</code> in <code>App</code>.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/12-kcl-app-schema-c8a782c65f4e0ea0b2e05df754dd03f6.png" width="1364" height="588" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fig. 12: KCL code validation with constraint rules.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="24-isolated-configuration-block-merging">2.4 Isolated Configuration Block Merging<a href="#24-isolated-configuration-block-merging" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>KCL provides the ability to write isolated configuration blocks and automatically merge them, and supports idempotent merge, patch merge, and other strategies. Multiple configurations in idempotent merging need to meet the exchange law, and developers need to manually handle configuration conflicts between base and different environments. The patch merging includes overlay, deletion and addition. KCL simplifies the collaborative development on the user side and reduces the coupling between configurations through multiple merging strategies.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/13-kcl-isolated-config-e7faa3b3f96a18e52a702cb39427931c.png" width="1638" height="842" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fig. 13: Multi-environment scenario configuration block writing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="25-automation">2.5 Automation<a href="#25-automation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>KCL provides many automation-related capabilities, mainly including tools and multilingual APIs. Via <code>package_identifier : key_identifier</code> mode, KCL supports the indexing of any configured key value, thus completing the addition, deletion, modification and query of any key value. For example, Fig 14. shows that we can directly execute the following command to modify the image. The code diff before and after modification is also shown in Fig. 14.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/14-kcl-image-update-80dc55f27d4f69507a7f00c20e7d62d8.png" width="1828" height="502" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fig. 14: Automatic modification of application configuration image via KCL CLI/API.</p><p>In addition, the automation capability of KCL can be realized and integrated into CI/CD as shown in Fig. 15.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/15-kcl-automation-2eda1a821f8a1b7ef01e4d09891e595b.png" width="890" height="247" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Fig. 15: Typical KCL automation integration.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-comparison-between-kcl-and-other-declarative-configurations">3.

For large-scale cloud native configuration scenarios that need frequent modifications, they are more suitable for KCL. The main difference involved is the difference between configuration data abstraction and deployment:</p><p>The advantages of using KCL for configuration are: for static data, the advantage of abstracting one layer means that the overall system has <strong>deployment flexibility</strong>. Different configuration environments, tenants, and runtime may have different requirements for static data, and even different organizations may have different specifications and product requirements. KCL can be used to expose the most needed and frequently modified configurations to users.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="32-vs-kustomize">3.2 vs. Kustomize<a href="#32-vs-kustomize" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The core capability of Kustomize is its file-level overlay capability. However, there is a problem with multiple overlay chains, because finding the statement of a specific attribute value does not guarantee that it is the final value, because another specific value that appears elsewhere can override it. For complex scenarios, retrieval of the inheritance chain of Kustomize files is often not as convenient as retrieval of the inheritance chain of KCL code, The specified configuration file overwrite order needs to be carefully considered. In addition, Kustomize cannot solve the problems of YAML configuration writing, constraint verification, model abstraction and development, and is more suitable for simple configuration scenarios.</p><p>In KCL, the configuration merge operation can be fine-grained to each configuration attribute in the code, and the merge strategy can be flexibly set, not limited to the overall resource, and the dependency between configurations can be statically analyzed through the import statement of KCL.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="33-vs-hcl">3.3 vs. HCL<a href="#33-vs-hcl" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="331-features">3.3.1 Features<a href="#331-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>HCL</th><th>KCL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Modeling</td><td>The user interface is not directly perceived through the Terraform provider Schema definition.

schema. It can be seen that compared with Terraform HCL, KCL constraints can be written more simply when the same functions are implemented (validation and condition fields do not need to be written repeatedly like Terraform), In addition, it provides the ability to set fields as optional (unlike the Terraform configuration field, which can be null by default).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="34-vs-cue">3.4 vs. CUE<a href="#34-vs-cue" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="341-features">3.4.1 Features<a href="#341-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>CUE</th><th>KCL</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Modeling</td><td>Modeling through struct, no inheritance and other features, can achieve high abstraction when there is no conflict between model definitions. Because CUE performs all constraint checks at runtime, there may be performance bottlenecks in large-scale modeling scenarios.</td><td>Modeling is conducted through KCL schema, and high model abstraction can be achieved through language level engineering and some object-oriented features (such as single inheritance). KCL is a statically compiled language with low overhead for large-scale modeling scenarios.</td></tr><tr><td>Constraint</td><td>CUE combines types and values into one concept. It simplifies the writing of constraints through various syntax. For example, generic types and enumerations are not required. Summing types and null value merging are the same thing.</td><td>KCL provides a richer check declarative constraint syntax, which makes it easier to write. For some configuration field combination constraints, it is simpler to write (compared with CUE, KCL provides more if guard combination constraints, all/any/map/filter and other collection constraint writing methods, which makes it easier to write)</td></tr><tr><td>Scalability</td><td>CUE supports configuration merging but it is completely idempotent. It may not meet the requirements of complex multi-tenant and multi- environment configuration scenarios</td><td>KCL can customize the configuration block writing method and multiple strategies to meet the requirements of complex multi-tenant and multi-environment configuration scenarios.</td></tr><tr><td>Code writing</td><td>For complex loop and constraint scenarios, it is complex to write, and it is cumbersome to write scenarios that require accurate configuration modifications.</td><td>Complex structure definition, loop, and conditional constraint scenarios are easy to write.</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="342-examples">3.4.2 Examples<a href="#342-examples" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to heading"
